      <h4>What is a dividend?</h4>
      <p>
          A dividend is a portion of a company's profits to its stockholders, those who own stocks for that comapny. A dividend is often decided by the board of directors for that comapny. Simple put, the company gives money to its stockholders as a way of keeping investors.Stocks that pay dividends are good stocks to purchase and to "baghold", to hold for a long time. If you hold enough stocks that pay dividends, it can turn into getting a paycheck regulary, without having to work for it.

      <h4>What is diversification?</h4>
      <p>Diversification is the process in which one diversifies their portfolio to mitigate risk. In the case of economic events that cause a stock's price to decrease, a person does not lose a large amount of money. By diversifying one's investments into different companies, indices, and markets, the overall risk to losing large amounts of money is decreased. Diversifying one's portfolio also allows the portfolio to remain liquidable during times in which some investments are not liquidated easily.</p>
